This file describes the files found in this repo and what they contain.

run_analysis.R: this is the R script that will reconstitute the raw data found at:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

This script assumes the data sets are unzipped and located in R's working directory.  
(The folder name UCI HAR Dataset should be located in R's working directory.)

CodeBook.md describes in detail the origin of the raw data, the transformations the script
executes, and the data dictionary of the resulting file.
